<Tabs>
  <Tabs.Tab eventKey="home" title="Home">
    My heavy fox, you inspire me to write. How I love the way you skip, sleep
    and sneer, Invading my mind day and through the night, Always dreaming about
    the cunning smear.
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab eventKey="profile" title="Profile">
    Let me compare you to an ideal spoon? You are more deadpan, stunning and
    scaly. Fun sun heats the surreal peaches of June, And summertime has the
    vernal qualey.
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab eventKey="contact" title="Contact" disabled>
    How do I love you? Let me count the ways. I love your clad ankle, elbows and
    smile. Thinking of your glad elbows fills my days. My love for you is the
    bally air mile.
  </Tabs.Tab>
